# IN PROGRESS PROJECT

## Why make this? 
I really dislike opening a different tab for some task I need to change in an Active Directory Machine (especially in Server 19). 


This project will: 
- LDAP Bind to the AD Machine 
- List all of the users 
- Get information about a specific user (GPO, Permissions) 

Maybe some extra features: 
- Create a new user
- Reset password
- GPO user removal and adding
- disable and enabling accounts
